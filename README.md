_Atlas_ (**A**utomatic **T**ask **L**ist **A**dministration **S**ystem) is my own personal task management tool.

It is a customised version of the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) system (with multiple input files,
slightly different format rules and syntax, prioritization across entire portfolio, and potentially much more).
It thus falls under the category of tools which support the [broad GTD methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)
of project and task administration.

Over time I have developed my own personal management methodology, and I am developing _Atlas_ to support it.

_Atlas_ is in very stages of development, currently unstable and buggy. A very rough prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/nov314k/atlas-v01).

_Atlas_ is free (as in freedom!) and open source software released under the [GNU General Public License Version 3](LICENSE.md).
