# What is Atlas?

> Happiness is the pursuit of worthwhile goals in key areas of life.
> This pursuit is done by continuously completing smaller prioritized tasks.

Atlas (Automatic Task List Administration System) is a personal task management tool. It automatically compiles a daily todo task list based on task definitions in all relevant areas of life, and personal preferences.

Atlas helps you to:

* Break up goals into tasks
* Prioritize and sequence tasks
* Focus on what needs to be done _right now_
* Store new tasks and ideas for processing later on.

# How Does it Work?

Atlas workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Define all tasks that need to be done in each area of life
2. Select tasks with highest priority (top tasks) 
3. Specify personal schedulling preferences
4. Run Atlas to produce a daily todo task list.

As tasks are done during the day, they can be marked as done, or for further reschedulling.

# Development Status and Limitations

Atlas is in very early stages of development, and a lot of new features are in the works.

Atlas is best suited for one's own personal use, rather than for large and complex projects.
