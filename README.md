# What is Atlas

Atlas (Automatic Task List Administration System) is a personal task management tool. It automatically compiles a daily todo task list based on task definitions in all relevant areas of life, and personal preferences.

Atlas helps you to:

* Break up goals into tasks
* Prioritize and sequence tasks
* Focus on what needs to be done _right now_
* Store new tasks and ideas for processing later on.

# Atlas Workflow

Atlas workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Define all tasks that need to be done in each area of life
2. Select tasks with highest priority (top tasks) 
3. Specify personal schedulling preferences
4. Run Atlas to produce a daily todo task list.

# Text Files and Portfolios

In Atlas, tasks are defined in plain text files and daily task lists are given as plain text files; everything is text-file based. Simple markdown-style format is used to enable us to more expressively define tasks, and also to tell Atlas what we want done.

By an 'area of life' we mean a group of tasks whose completion leads to a single goal. It is left to the user to organize and name areas of life as they wish. For example, _Transport_ may be an area of life. Tasks within this area may be:

* Wash the red car
* Wash the blue car
* Pay insurance for both cars
* Buy new seat covers

A single file may contain tasks related to one life area only, or a number of (smaller) life areas may be grouped in one file. All user-defined files, together with some files created by Atlas, make up a **portfolio**.
