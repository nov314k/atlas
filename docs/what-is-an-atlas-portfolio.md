# What is an Atlas portfolio?

In Atlas, tasks are defined in plain text files and daily task lists are given as plain text files; everything is text-file based. Simple markdown-style format is used to enable us to more expressively define tasks, and also to tell Atlas what we want done.

By an 'area of life' we mean a group of tasks whose completion leads to a single goal. It is left to the user to organize and name areas of life as they wish. For example, _Transport_ may be an area of life. Tasks within this area may be:

* Wash the red car
* Wash the blue car
* Pay insurance for both cars
* Buy new seat covers

A single file may contain tasks related to one life area only, or a number of (smaller) life areas may be grouped in one file. All user-defined files, together with some files created by Atlas, make up a **portfolio**.
