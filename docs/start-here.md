# What is _Atlas_?

> Happiness is the pursuit of worthwhile goals in key areas of life.
> This pursuit is done by continuously completing smaller and prioritized tasks.

_Atlas_ (Automatic Task List Administration System) is a personal task management tool. It automatically compiles a daily todo task list based on task definitions in all relevant areas of life, and personal preferences.

> "Happiness does not come from doing easy work, but from the
> afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a
> difficult task that demanded our best." Theodore Isaac Rubin

# What can _Atlas_ do for you?

_Atlas_ helps you to:

# How does it work?

_Atlas_ workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Define all tasks that need to be done in each area of life
2. Select tasks with highest priority (top tasks) 
3. Specify personal schedulling preferences
4. Run _Atlas_ to produce a daily todo task list.

As tasks are done during the day, they can be marked as done, or for further reschedulling. This information can be used for evaluating one's performance by _Atlas_.
