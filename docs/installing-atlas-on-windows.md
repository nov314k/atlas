# Installing Atlas on Windows

## Download source code

You must first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/novakpetrovic/atlas.git

## Create a virtual environment

It is best to create and work within a virtual environment.
This is especially true if you are evaluating Atlas.

```
python -m venv atlas
cd atlas
Scripts\activate.bat
```

Upgrade to the latest version of `pip` in the virtual environment:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Install packages
