## Notes on terminology

A non-recurring task with a due date is a booked task rather than a due task. Using 'booked' is preferred because:

* It can be shortened to b: (as in that case d: is already taken).
* 'Booked' has a more definitive meaning that it has to be done by the given date.
* On the other hand, 'due' sounds more as an estimate of when the task may be done.

## Task parts

The entire taske line is task description (?) / task line (?) / task specification (?).

Task text is task text (?) / task directive (?) / task specification (?).
