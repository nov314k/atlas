# _Atlas_ rationale

Here we explain the rationale on the basis of which _Atlas_ was built. In order to do that, we will first provide an overview of our basic life philosophy, and then proceed to show how _Atlas_ helps to realize that philosophy in practice.

## Basic life philosophy

For us, the aim (or purpose) of life is to be happy. We define happiness as the result of achieving goals that we feel are worthwhile. We make no judgements about the 'worthwhile-ness' of anybody's goals; our choice of goals is a part of our personal expression and contribution to the World. A sense of passion and purpose is often the result of correctly identifying what is worthwhile to us.

Our goals generally fall in what we call **life areas** (LAs). Life areas do not need to be constant or the same for everybody. But, generally they encompass the following areas of human concern: work, family, home, finances, transport, fitness, social life, hobbies, etc. In each of these life areas, we simply want to be content with the status of affairs, and for things to be going well. However, while this general want is valid, it does not really constitute a proper goal.

**Goals** are specific and timed outcomes. Specific means that their completion can be easily tested and verified, and timed means that they have a certain date by which they need to be achieved. Goals can also be ordered in terms of their relative priorities.

In order to reach our goals, we need to perform a series (or a sequence) of actions. At the time of setting a goal, it may not be clear which actions to perform, and in what order. Often, as we review our progress towards a goal, it may be necessary to introduce new actions, update old ones, change their order, and so on. Because of this, the due date for achieving a goal is not known with great certainty.

An action, whose outcome is clearly specified and can be tested, and whose duration is known with a considerable degree of certainty, we call a **task**. Tasks lead towards achieving goals, and they can generally be done in 'one go', without much uncertainty. While we may not know for sure how to achieve a certain goal, we know how to perform tasks, we have done them (or similar tasks) before.

Collections of tasks within a goal can be grouped into **signposts**, which are basically stepping stones, or sub-goals, on the way to reaching a goal. Signposts are useful in breaking down goals into even more manageable units, which are easier to track and sequence. Signposts are effectively the same concept as **composite tasks**, a collection of related tasks. The difference between composite tasks and signposts is that composite tasks are of a more temporary and practical nature, rather than being a more permanent stepping stone on the way to reaching a goal.

While goals are many, resources are limited. This is a fact of life. In order to accomodate for this, we assign priorities to goals, signposts, and tasks. Since completing tasks is the main activity in this life philosophy, at any given moment in time we have a number of tasks from a range of goals and life areas competing for our attention and resources. We have to be able to systematically determine, on at least a daily basis, what the most important tasks to complete are. This allows us to focus on the most important tasks.

Given our priority settings and schedulling preferences, **daily tasks list** (DTL) is an automatically generated compilation of tasks that need to be done on a particular day.

Most people, regardless of their broader philosophical or religious persuasion, should be able to fit under the umbrella of our basic (and very general) life philosophy.

## The purpose of _Atlas_

The purpose of _Atlas_ is to support the application of the basic life philosophy in daily life.

This means that, at its core, _Atlas_ aims to provide the following functionality:

* To provide a way to specify and record goals, signposts, and tasks in all life areas;
* To provide a way to assign priorities to tasks;
* To provide a way to systematically generate daily tasks lists.
