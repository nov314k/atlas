# _Atlas_ rationale

Here we explain the rationale on the basis of which _Atlas_ was built. In order to do that, we will first provide an overview of our basic life philosophy, and then proceed to show how _Atlas_ helps to realize that philosophy in practice.

# Basic life philosophy

For us, the aim (or purpose) of life is to be happy. We define happiness as the result of achieving goals that we feel are worthwhile. We make no judgements about the 'worthwhile-ness' of anybody's goals; our choice of goals is a part of our personal expression and contribution to the World. A sense of passion and purpose is often the result of correctly identifying what is worthwhile to us.

Our goals generally fall in what we call 'life areas' (LAs). Life areas do not need to be constant or the same for everybody. But, generally they encompass the following areas of human concern: work, family, home, finances, transport, fitness, social life, hobbies, etc. In each of these life areas, we simply want to be content with the status of affairs, and for things to be going well. However, while this general want is valid, it does not really constitute a proper goal.

Goals are specific and timed outcomes. Specific means that their completion can be easily tested and verified, and timed means that they have a certain date by which they need to be achieved. Goals can also be ordered in terms of their relative priorities.

In order to reach our goals, we need to perform a series of actions, sometimes known, and sometimes unknown at the moment of setting the goal. These actions often need to be performed in a certain sequence, and modified based on the intermediate development of events. We formally define these actions as 'tasks'. 





Most people, regardless of their broader philosophical or religious persuasion, should be able to fit under the umbrella of our basic (and very general) life philosophy.

Since _Atlas_ deals with personal management, it is useful to first consider the philosophical framework on the basis of which the _Atlas_ approach to personal management is built. We will start by defining what we see as an overall aim (purpose) of life, then define what we mean by goals, and finally define what a task means for us.
